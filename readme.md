Backend API testing


The project is done using Java with RestAssured and JsonPath libraries.
To run the test open the project in Eclipse and right-click on src/com/api/test/restapitester/ApiTest.java file,
choose "Run as" -> "JUnit test".
(please see pl_b_api_demo.mp4)

After test passed verify there are no failed tests.


Tests are run in alphabetic order.


Tests list:

- a_001_makeSureSiteIsUp: verify the API link is correct (response 200 is received),
and the response format is JSON.

- a_002_getJsonResponse: not a test in strict meaning, populates "json_string" for next tests.
